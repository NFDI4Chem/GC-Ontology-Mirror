This repository contains a copy of the Gainsville Core Ontology that was developed by Chemical Semantics in 2015.
We had to create this repo in order to be able to ingest this ontology for research purposes within the [NFDI4Chem Terminology Service](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de), since the original IRI does not resolve anymore.
The ontology was taken from this snapshot of the internet arcieve: https://web.archive.org/web/20221005233201fw_/http://ontologies.makolab.com/gc/gc07.owl
Since this archieved version imports outdated and unresolvable versions of BFO and QUDT, the associated import statements where commented out (see: https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/GC-Ontology-Mirror/blob/main/gc07_without_imports.owl#L20-L22).
